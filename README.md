## About

memoQ is a powerful CAT tool designed to streamline translation and localization workflows. This repository offers tools and tips to extend memoQ’s capabilities and improve your productivity.
---

## Getting Started

- Download memoQ from the [official site](https://www.memoq.com/download).  
- Check the system requirements to ensure compatibility.  
- This repo assumes you have a basic understanding of memoQ’s interface and features.
---

## Setting Up Your Environment

- Configure memoQ to your needs: set preferred languages, translation memories, and term bases.  
- For scripting and automation, ensure you have the correct environment (e.g., PowerShell, Python).  
- Use the provided regex patterns by importing them into memoQ filters or QA rules.
---

## Common Workflow Tips

- Import files using supported formats (XLIFF, DOCX, etc.) for best results.  
- Keep translation memories updated to improve match rates.  
- Use LiveDocs for contextual reference during translation.
---

## Automation and Scripting

- Automate repetitive tasks like project creation or batch QA using scripts or creating templates in memoQ.  
- Use memoQ’s API for advanced automation scenarios.  
- Refer to the `scripts.md` file for ready-to-use examples.
---

## Regex and Search Tips

- memoQ uses Perl-compatible regex (PCRE); test your patterns carefully.  
- Use regex to find formatting errors, placeholders, or specific tags.  
- Sample regex patterns are provided in `Regex`.
---

## Quality Assurance Best Practices

- Enable memoQ’s built-in QA checks for consistency and formatting errors.  
- Customize QA rules using regex to catch project-specific issues.  
- Review matches and terminology regularly to maintain quality.
---

## Performance Optimization

- For large projects, split files to avoid slowdowns.  
- Clear cache and temporary files periodically.  
- Optimize your translation memories by removing duplicates.
---

## Collaboration Tips

- Use memoQ server or cloud for seamless team collaboration.  
- Sync translation memories before and after work sessions to prevent conflicts.  
- Establish clear roles for translators, reviewers, and PMs.
---

## Troubleshooting

- Common errors and fixes are documented in `toolkit/docs.troubleshooting.md`.  
- Regex patterns not working? Double-check escape characters and test them outside memoQ first (for example [regexr](https://regexr.com/)).
