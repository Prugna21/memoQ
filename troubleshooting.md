## Common Issues and Solutions

### Regex Patterns Not Matching Correctly
- **Problem:** Your regex does not find the expected matches in memoQ.
- **Solutions:**
  - Ensure you are using **Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE)** syntax, which memoQ supports.
  - Double-check all escape characters (e.g., use `\\` to match a literal backslash).
  - Test your regex patterns with external tools like [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/) set to PCRE flavor.
  - Avoid greedy quantifiers if you want non-greedy matches (`.*?` instead of `.*`).

### Scripts Fail to Run or Throw Errors
- **Problem:** Automation scripts in this repo do not execute properly.
- **Solutions:**
  - Confirm you have the correct runtime environment (e.g., Python 3.x, PowerShell).
  - Check for required dependencies or modules.
  - Run scripts from the directory where they reside to avoid path issues.
  - Read error messages carefully and check line numbers for debugging.
  - For memoQ API scripts, ensure your memoQ server URL and credentials are correctly configured.

### Slow Performance on Large Projects
- **Problem:** memoQ slows down or freezes when loading large files.
- **Solutions:**
  - Split large projects into smaller chunks.
  - Clear memoQ cache via **Options > Advanced > Clear cache**.
  - Archive or clean unused translation memories.
  - Close other heavy applications to free system resources.

---

### Sync Conflicts in Team Projects
- **Problem:** Conflicts arise when multiple translators work on the same project.
- **Solutions:**
  - Always sync before starting work and after finishing.
  - Communicate with your team to avoid overlapping edits.
  - Use memoQâ€™s **Check-in/Check-out** features properly.
  - Contact your memoQ server admin if conflicts persist.
