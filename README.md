[memoQ](https://www.memoq.com/) is a computer-assisted translation (CAT) tool used by translators and localization teams to manage and streamline translation workflows. It supports translation memory, terminology databases, and various file formats, helping users maintain consistency across projects. memoQ also includes features for project management and collaboration, making it suitable for both individual translators and teams.

In this repository, I’d like to collect and organize all our memoQ-related resources—such as regex patterns, configuration options, and useful features—so they’re easily accessible to the team.
